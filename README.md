- What was your motivation?

My motivation to build this note taker was to make sure i have a specific place to jot down any idea or note that may come to mind. I built this project to make sure i have my own spot to make my wn notes without feeling like anyone can open my stuff!! it solves the problem of privacy! i feel like i have way more of that now! I learned i can do all things through christ who provides me strength.
